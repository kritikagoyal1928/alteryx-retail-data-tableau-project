Assumptions Taken
-----------------

1. WeekStart is assumed to be Monday, and WeekEnd is calculated as WeekStart + 6 days.

2. Inventory SnapshotDate always occurs on Monday, so it aligns directly with the WeekStart date.

3. Sales data is assumed to follow the same Monday–Sunday weekly structure, ensuring consistent joins between sales and inventory.

4. Any null Net Sales values in the sales dataset are treated as 0, assuming no sales occurred.

5. Fields such as On_Hand, On_Order, and Safety Stock may contain a dash (“–”) in the raw data; these are interpreted as 0 for calculation purposes.

6. For some Store ID + Material combinations, data is missing for the week of 7/14/2025. These will appear as blank gaps in the final dashboard.
